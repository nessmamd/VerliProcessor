# Verilog Personal Project: Designing a Simple Processor

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and simulate a basic processor using Verilog. This processor will consist of various components, including an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit, and registers. The goal is to integrate these components to create a simple processor architecture, such as a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture. The project will culminate in simulating the processor's behavior using Verilog simulation tools to ensure correct functionality.

## Description
The project involves several key steps:

1. **Component Design**: Start by designing each of the necessary components of the processor using Verilog. This includes the ALU, control unit, and registers. Each component should be designed to perform its respective function efficiently and accurately.

2. **Processor Architecture**: Integrate the designed components to create a simple processor architecture. Consider the instruction set architecture (ISA) and design principles of a RISC processor. Define the instruction set and ensure that the processor can execute basic instructions efficiently.

3. **Simulation**: Once the processor architecture is complete, simulate its behavior using Verilog simulation tools. Create test cases to verify the functionality of the processor under different scenarios. Ensure that the processor executes instructions correctly, performs arithmetic and logic operations accurately, and maintains proper state.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
   
3. Open the project in your preferred Verilog development environment.

4. Begin by designing the individual components of the processor (ALU, control unit, registers) in separate Verilog modules.

5. Integrate the components to create the processor architecture, following the design principles of a RISC processor.

6. Write test benches for each component and the overall processor architecture to simulate their behavior.

7. Run simulations to verify the correctness and functionality of the processor design.
